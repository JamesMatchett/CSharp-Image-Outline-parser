# CSharp-Image-Outline-parser
initial ideas into Image processing in C#

just change the paths listed in the c# code, one pointing to the image you want processed and one to where you want the contrast map generated saved. Might also be worthwhile changing the contrast coefficients in the if statements when writing to the colour arrays per image, working on method to generate them ad hoc.
